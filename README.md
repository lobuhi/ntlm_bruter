## NOTE: This fork uses a single list that contains `user:passwd` on each line instead of using separated users and password list. 

NTLM Bruter is a simple tool that bruteforces the usernames/passwords against the application with HTTP NTLM Authentication.

Usage: ```python3 ntlm.py [Target_URL] [AD_Domain_Name]```

Note: It is highly recommended to use your own wordlists.
